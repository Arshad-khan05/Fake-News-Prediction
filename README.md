# Fake News Prediction

## Description
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a news article is fake or real. Using a dataset of news articles, the model processes the text to classify it into genuine or fake categories. The project leverages natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms for accurate predictions.

## Features
- Preprocessing of text data including tokenization and vectorization.
- Implementation of machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines.
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Real-time prediction functionality using pre-trained models.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn
